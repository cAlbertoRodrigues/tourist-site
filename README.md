## 🧾 Explanation of the Code

### `index.html`

- Uses semantic tags such as `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
- Content is organized into blocks with descriptive classes:
- `.container`: introduction to the location (Busan)
- `.secondContainer`: list of historical attractions
- `.credits`: footer with credits

### `style.css`

- Defines CSS variables (`--Open`, `--headline`, `--red`, etc.).
- Uses utility classes for spacing (`.padding-bottom`) and colors.
- Images with `.img` have `border-radius` and are responsive.
- Themed colors by attraction type (e.g., `#blue` for "History," `#pink` for "Families").
